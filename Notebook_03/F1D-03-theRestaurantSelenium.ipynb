    "If you are webscraping with Python chances are that you have already tried urllib, httplib, requests, etc. These are excellent libraries, but some websites don’t like to be webscraped. In these cases you may need to disguise your webscraping bot as a human being. Selenium is just the tool for that. Selenium is a webdriver: it takes control of your browser, which then does all the work. Hence what the website “sees” is Chrome or Firefox or IE; it does not see Python or Selenium. That makes it a lot harder for the website to tell your bot from a human being.\n",

I will also show you how to make your code work for any number of search results in LexisNexis (the code we’ve seen so far only works when the number of results is 1 to 500; if there are 0 results or 500+ results the code will crash).
